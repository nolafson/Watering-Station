# Watering-Station
Olivia's Science Project
// Olivia is in the 6th Grade and doing a Watering-Station robotics project with her classmate Mathilda.  She is following the project steps and purchasing materials as shown by Robotgeek.com.  Mathilda is writing the paper that describes the project and is in Hawaii for spring break. Olivia will construct the project while Mathilda is away, and her first step is to assemble the pumping station for the  project.  She began this yesterday (3/23/18) and is in the wiring stage for it.  
// The next step is the coding for the project.  She will retrieve and install the coding into the Geekduino (Arduino).  
// When these two steps are completed Olivia will test the Geekduino/pumping station connection to ensure they work together.
